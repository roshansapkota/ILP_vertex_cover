# ILP_vertex_cover_problem

The problem is to implement Integer Programming Language(ILP) for the vertex cover problem using Gurobi. The program asks the user the number of vertices (say X) of the graph. Then randomly generate a connected graph that will have X vertices. It then randomly assign edges in such a way so that the range of edges for any vertex should be 
between 1 to X/2. The graph should be connected all the time. Once, your graph is ready then the program solves ILP to get the solution of the problem.
